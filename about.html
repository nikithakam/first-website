  <h1>About Me </h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Nikitha Kamath and I am studying business administration with a minor in computer science.
	   I possess a keen desire to learn more about finance and technology, along with combining these areas with my passions of teaching and community service. 
	   In my free time, you can catch me journaling, listening to music, or watching the latest holiday movie on Netflix!
